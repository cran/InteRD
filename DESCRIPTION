Description: We developed the Integrated and Robust Deconvolution algorithm to infer cell-type proportions from target bulk RNA-seq data. This package is able to effectively integrate deconvolution results from multiple scRNA-seq datasets and calibrates estimates from reference-based deconvolution by taking into account extra biological information as priors. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is robust to inaccurate external information imposed in the deconvolution system.
